# Bugs / Issues
* Download halts/freezes. If this happens, delays might need to be increased in the settings.
* Program sometimes does not close out the process completely, which eats up the memory. If this happens, end the process with task manager.
* No sign of progress? Your book might possibly not be compatible. Certain Chegg eBooks use a different format that will not work with the current method used to snapshot the pages. Here are some signs that a book might not be compatible:
     1. Page heights vary from page to page.
     2. The next button is not located horizontally, but instead vertically.
* Having problems that aren't listed here? [Try a previous version.](https://github.com/lulzsun/Chegg-E-book-to-PDF/tree/1.0.1)
